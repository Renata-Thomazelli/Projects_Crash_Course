# Hi, this is not a big deal but very interesting and useful. This is  problem suggested by site Rosalind, and this is the problem 3
# Given: A string s of length at most 200 letters and four integers a, b, c and d.

#Return: The slice of this string from indices a through b and c through d (with space in between), inclusively. In other words, we should include elements s[b] and s[d] in our slice.
#This is the problem a received:

#17 25 98 102

# the solution would be:

s ="Sc89JbT6rcL33nncoMegophrys0vQPr92dZJFOuh7LcZsuIeF3tFPwNCCRncaMUa7QvuR8RtPYfp6Sxn9ajruOrgtW2cFIoqq6iberaBDMlqvlV4CxhA5I6jz0bprMkzxYV1HwkQNyQ2NyruTWnERUBACfaPSY6."
print (s[17:25+1],s[98:102+1])

# output: Megophrys ibera
