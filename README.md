***
>## 1.1 Ex1 - Sorting a List
>>* Sort a list permanently with the __`sort ()`__ Method
>>* Use sorted list with tuplas
>>* Print list as sorted but not permanantly
>>* Reverse sort with __`reverse=True`__
>>* Ignoring Capital letter with __`casefold`__
>>* __`lambda` function__
    
>## 1.2 Ex2 - The Big Dinner
>>* Print list
>>* Work with __`title()`__ method
>>* Remove a item by its value
>>* Changing a item by its index
>>* The differences between __`insert()`__ and __`append()` method__
>>* Using a pop method to exclud and use this value excluded.

>## 1.3 Ex3 - if Statements
 >* In this exercise you will see:
 >>   * how so solve a problem providing that it new user be unique
 >>   * considering case sensitive, even when the name of the new user just change the case letter to upper or lower
 >>   * for that we use:
 >>> * __`for in`__
 >>> * __`map`__
 >>> * __`str.lower`__
 >>> * __`title`__
 >>> * __`lambda`__ othe way to do it
 
 >## 1.4 Ex6 - Working with dictionaries, nesting and loops.
>Here you will see:
>>How to access and modify individual elements in a dictionary.
>>How to loop through a dictionaryâ€™s:
>>>key-value pairs, its keys, and its values.

>>Nesting multiple dictionaries in a list, nest lists in a dictionary, and nest a dictionary inside a dictionary.

>>And also how to access each information of the list and dictionaries nested in each other through a loop.

 >## 1.5 Ex7 - User input and while loops.
 >* #####  How input() funciton works
* #####  Using int() to accept numerical Input
* ##### The Modulo Operator
* ##### Using a flag
* ##### Using a message 'quit' to stop a loop
* ##### Using break to exit a loop
* ##### Using continue to still in a loop
* ##### Avoiding infinit loops
* ##### Removing all instances of specify values from a list
* ##### Filling a Dictionary with User Input
