>### *Here you can find some projects did with Python. Some of them were proposed by Data Science Academy, other by Rosalind site and others I did on my own. I hope you enjoy it.*


# 1 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISES FROM ROSALIND SITE 
***

## 1.1 In problem 3 
>The Challenge is to return The slice of a string from indices a through b and c through d (with space in between), inclusively. In other words, we should include elements s[b] and s[d] in our slice.

## 1.2 In problem 4 
>Challenge: 
>>Return: The sum of all odd integers from a through b, inclusively. We have these integers 4916 and 9583

## 1.3 In problem 5 
>This is a really good challenge. We have a doc.txt and we have to return just the even-numbers line of it. 
>>for this challenge you can:  
>>>* Do a __loop__ or 
>>>* You can also __`import sys`__ and __`import intertools`__

>## 2.1 Ex1 - Sorting a List
>>* Sort a list permanently with the __`sort ()`__ Method
>>* Use sorted list with tuplas
>>* Print list as sorted but not permanantly
>>* Reverse sort with __`reverse=True`__
>>* Ignoring Capital letter with __`casefold`__
>>* __`lambda` function__
    
>## 2.2 Ex2 - The Big Dinner
>>* Print list
>>* Work with __`title()`__ method
>>* Remove a item by its value
>>* Changing a item by its index
>>* The differences between __`insert()`__ and __`append()` method__
>>* Using a pop method to exclud and use this value excluded.

>## 2.3 Ex3 - if Statements
 >* In this exercise you will see:
 >>   * how so solve a problem providing that it new user be unique
 >>   * considering case sensitive, even when the name of the new user just change the case letter to upper or lower
 >>   * for that we use:
 >>> * __`for in`__
 >>> * __`map`__
 >>> * __`str.lower`__
 >>> * __`title`__
 >>> * __`lambda`__ othe way to do it
 
 >## 2.4 Ex6 - Working with dictionaries, nesting and loops.
>Here you will see:
>>How to access and modify individual elements in a dictionary.
>>How to loop through a dictionaryâ€™s:
>>>key-value pairs, its keys, and its values.

>>Nesting multiple dictionaries in a list, nest lists in a dictionary, and nest a dictionary inside a dictionary.

>>And also how to access each information of the list and dictionaries nested in each other through a loop.

   
# 3 BIOINFORMATIC     
***   
>## 3.1 Counting DNA Nucleotides
>>In this exercise we need to count it of the DNA molecules:  adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).
>>Here I did a dictionary just to see how it works e tran I used count() Method to count it of the letters we have in this string.
    
>## 3.2 Transcribing DNA into RNA
>>Here we use __`replace()`__ method to change Uracil into Thymine molecules into the string.

>## 3.3 Complement a Strand of DNA
>>Here we worked with __dictinary__ to created a key and value for it replace that is necessary to do.
>>For to do this replacement we used a __loop__ __`for`__ __`in`__.
>>In the and we print this new string in the __reverse order__.
>>We also used __case low__ and __case upper__.
