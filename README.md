>### *Here you can find some projects did with Python. Some of them were proposed by Data Science Academy, other by Rosalind site and others I did on my own. I hope you enjoy it.*


# 1 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISES FROM ROSALIND SITE 
***

## 1.1 In problem 3 
>The Challenge is to return The slice of a string from indices a through b and c through d (with space in between), inclusively. In other words, we should include elements s[b] and s[d] in our slice.

## 1.2 In problem 4 
>Challenge: 
>>Return: The sum of all odd integers from a through b, inclusively. We have these integers 4916 and 9583

## 1.3 In problem 5 
>This is a really good challenge. We have a doc.txt and we have to return just the even-numbers line of it. 
>>for this challenge you can:  
>>>* Do a __loop__ or 
>>>* You can also __`import sys`__ and __`import intertools`__ 
           
# 2 PYTHON CRASH COURSE BOOK_EXERCISES_AND_EXAMPLES
***
>## 2.1 Example 1 - Sorting a List
>>* Sort a list permanently with the __`sort ()`__ Method
>>* Use sorted list with tuplas
>>* Print list as sorted but not permanantly
>>* Reverse sort with __`reverse=True`__
>>* Ignoring Capital letter with __`casefold`__
>>* __`lambda` function__
    
>## 2.2 Example 2 - The Big Dinner
>>* Print list
>>* Work with __`title()`__ method
>>* Remove a item by its value
>>* Changing a item by its index
>>* The differences between __`insert()`__ and __`append()` method__
>>* Using a pop method to exclud and use this value excluded.
   
# 3 BIOINFORMATIC     
***   
>## 3.1 Counting DNA Nucleotides
>>In this exercise we need to count it of the DNA molecules:  adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).
>>Here I did a dictionary just to see how it works e tran I used count() Method to count it of the letters we have in this string
    
## 3.2 Transcribing DNA into RNA
>>Here we use __`replace()`__ method to change Uracil into Thymine molecules into the string
