# ProjectsinPython
#Here you can find some projects did with Python. Some of them were proposed by Data Science Academy, other by Rosalind site and others I did on my own. I hope you enjoy it.


# 1 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISES FROM ROSALIND SITE 

## 1.1 In problem 3 
>The Challenge was to return The slice of a string from indices a through b and c through d (with space in between), inclusively. In other words, we should include elements s[b] and s[d] in our slice.

## 1.2 In problem 4 
>Challenge: 
>>Return: The sum of all odd integers from a through b, inclusively. We have these integers 4916 and 9583

## 1.3 In problem 5 
>This is a really good challenge. We have a doc.txt and we have to return just the even-numbers line of it. 
>for this challenge you can:  
>> do a loop or you can also you can 
>> import sys and import intertools 
            
# 2 PYTHON CRASH COURSE BOOK_EXERCISES_AND_EXAMPLES

>## 2.1 Example 1 - Sorting a List
>>Permanently with the sort () Method
>>sorted list with tuplas
>>print list as sorted but not permanantly
>>reverse sort with reverse=True
>>ignoring Capital letter with casefold
>>lambda function
    
>## 2.2 Example 2 - The Big Dinner
>>print list
>>work with title() method
>>remove a item by its value
>>changing a item by its index
>>the differences between insert() and append() method
>>using a pop method to exclud and use this value excluded.
     
# 3 BIOINFORMATIC     
    
>## 3.1 Counting DNA Nucleotides
>>In this exercise we need to count it of the DNA molecules:  adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).
>>Here I did a dictionary just to see how it works e tran I used count() Method to count it of the letters we have in this string
    
## 3.2 Transcribing DNA into RNA
>>Here we use replace method() to change Uracil into Thymine molecules into the string
