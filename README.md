Here you can find many examples and tutorials from the book  
Python Crash Course - Hands-on, project-based introduction to programming.  
I'm so glad for Eric Matthes, for his work.  
Through this book, I learned from beginner to more complex works in Python.  
Before I read this book, I knew nothing.  
Here you can see my progress step by step.  
Once again thank you Eric Matthes.

* #####  Sort a list permanently with the __`sort ()`__ Method
* #####  Use sorted list with tuplas
* #####  Print list as sorted but not permanantly
* #####  Reverse sort with __`reverse=True`__
* #####  Ignoring Capital letter with __`casefold`__
* #####  __`lambda` function__

* #####  The differences between __`insert()`__ and __`append()` method__
* #####  Using a pop method to exclud and use this value excluded.

>## 1.3 Ex3 - if Statements
 >* In this exercise you will see:
 * #####  how so solve a problem providing that it new user be unique
 * #####  considering case sensitive, even when the name of the new user just change the case letter to upper or lower
 * #####  for that we use:
 >>> * __`for in`__
 >>> * __`map`__
 >>> * __`str.lower`__
 >>> * __`title`__
 >>> * __`lambda`__ othe way to do it

>Here you will see:
* ##### How to access and modify individual elements in a dictionary.
* ##### How to loop through a dictionaryâ€™s:
>>>key-value pairs, its keys, and its values.
* ##### Nesting multiple dictionaries in a list, nest lists in a dictionary, and nest a dictionary inside a dictionary.
* ##### And also how to access each information of the list and dictionaries nested in each other through a loop.

 >## 1.5 Ex7 - User input and while loops.

* #####  How input() funciton works
* #####  Using int() to accept numerical Input
* ##### The Modulo Operator
* ##### Using a flag
* ##### Using a message 'quit' to stop a loop
* ##### Using break to exit a loop
* ##### Using continue to still in a loop
* ##### Avoiding infinit loops
* ##### Removing all instances of specify values from a list
* ##### Filling a Dictionary with User Input
